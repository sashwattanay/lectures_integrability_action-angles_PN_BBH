\chapter{Introduction}



These lecture notes are based on Refs.~\cite{tanay2021action, tanay2021integrability, Cho:2019brd} which aim to give closed-form solutions to the spinning, eccentric
binary black hole dynamics at 1.5PN via two different equivalent ways:
the standard way and the one which uses action-angle variables.



Also these notes lack rigor. The above papers assume certain level of familiarity
with the symplectic geometric approach to classical mechanics, the non-fulfillment
of which on the reader's part may make the papers appear esoteric.
The purpose of these lecture notes is to give the reader this basic knowledge
which the above papers assume on the reader's part. If the reader 
finds these notes to be incomplete or lacking rigor, they are welcome to
refer to the sources cited in these notes as well as the above papers.



We use two kinds of filled boxes in these lecture notes
\begin{itemize}
\item The boxes with an explicit label ``Box'': These are meant
to give the reader a reference to more advanced sources to supplement
the material discussed herein. 
\item The boxes without an explicit label ``Box'': These simply 
summarize the important points.
\end{itemize}
